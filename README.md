# Data-Analysis-of-India-vs-China-Growth
<h3>Exploring the key development indicators of countrys growth in  terms of the following :- </h3>
1. Trade as a percentage of GDP.</br>
2. Import and Export of goods and services.</br>
3. GDP per capita.</br>
4. Poverty Alleviation.</br>
5. Life Expectancy.</br>
6. Urban Population growth.</br>
7. Adult Literacy Rate.</br>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
1. China appears to be 10 years ahead of India on most economic indicators such as GDP, trade and poverty alleviation.</br>
2. It's worth noting that China implemented economic reforms in 1978 and India in 1990 exactly 12 years apart, suggesting that this could be the most significant factor for India's 10-year economic growth gap with China.</br>
3. Despite the fact that China and India have different political models, the growth rates and trends in most indices are similar in both nations. This leads us to wonder if politics is really important.</br>
4. India is 20 to 25 years behind China in terms of education (literacy) and health care (infant mortality rate). <br/>
